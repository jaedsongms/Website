I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Public Administration and Government at Fundação Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration ([FGV-EAESP](https://eaesp.fgv.br/en)), in Brazil. I also hold a Master's degree in Public Management and International Cooperation from the Federal University of Paraíba ([UFPB](https://www.ccsa.ufpb.br/pgpci/contents/menu/pgpci-1/pgpci-1/english)) and a Bachelor's degree in Public Policies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://cchla.ufrn.br/ipp/gpp/)), both in Brazil. 

I have a background in quantitative methods, but i'm also have experience with qualitative methods (interviews, content analysis, etc.) in academic and applied research. Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a research assistant affiliated with the [Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/), under supervision of professor [Guillermo Toral](https://www.guillermotoral.com/).

My research focuses on the dynamics of federalism and the relationship between local governments, political institutions and public policies. In my doctoral thesis, I seek to analyze the influence of the dynamics of local political institutions on the diffusion of intermunicipal cooperation in Brazilian federalism.

Research topics: 
======
* Inter-municipal cooperation;
* Political economy of local governments collective action;
* Subnational diffusion of public policies;
* Local state capacities;
* Causal inference (Especially event study models).
