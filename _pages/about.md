I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Public Administration and Government at Fundação Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration ([FGV-EAESP](https://eaesp.fgv.br/en)), in Brazil. I also hold a Master's degree in Public Management and International Cooperation from the Federal University of Paraíba ([UFPB](https://www.ccsa.ufpb.br/pgpci/contents/menu/pgpci-1/pgpci-1/english)) and a Bachelor's degree in Public Policy from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://cchla.ufrn.br/ipp/gpp/)), both in Brazil. 

I have a background in quantitative methods, but I'm also have experience with qualitative methods in academic and applied research. Between 2021 and 2023, I worked as a research assistant affiliated with the [Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/), under supervision of professor [Guillermo Toral](https://www.guillermotoral.com/). Currently, I work as a researcher affiliated to the [Center for Studies in Public Administration and Government](https://eaesp.fgv.br/en/study-centers/center-public-administration-and-government-studies-ceapg) at Fundação Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration, and I`m a researcher affiliated to [The National Institute of Science and Technology, Quality of Government and Public Policies for Sustainable Development (QualiGov)](https://qualigov.pro.br/home).

My research examines the interplay between local political institutions and public policies in multilevel settings. In my doctoral dissertation, I explore how political and institutional dynamics influence inter-municipal cooperation decisions.

Research interests: 
======
* Political economy of federalism;
* Sub-national Political Institutions;
* Inter-municipal cooperation;
* Multilevel politics;
* Subnational diffusion of public policies;
* Local state capacities;
* Causal inference (Especially event study models).
