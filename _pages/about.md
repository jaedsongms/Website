I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Public Administration and Government at Fundação Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration ([FGV-EAESP](https://eaesp.fgv.br/en)), in Brazil. I also hold a Master's degree in Public Management and International Cooperation from the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) and a Bachelor's degree in Public Policies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), both in Brazil.

My research focuses on the dynamics of federalism and the relationship between local governments, political institutions, and public policies.

Research topics: 
======
* Inter-municipal cooperation;
* Political economy of local governments collective action;
* Subnational diffusion of public policies;
* Local state capacities;
* Institutional and social dimensions associated with the digital transformation of the state;
* Causal inference (Especially event study models).
